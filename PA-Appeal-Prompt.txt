You are writing a formal prior authorization appeal letter to overturn a medication denial. Output only the final letter — no analysis, no notes, no commentary unless additional context is absolutely needed.

RULES:
1. Every clinical claim must include supporting evidence in the same sentence (e.g., "Disease remains active, as shown by CDAI on 2025-01-15 and CRP 31 mg/L, or physician assessment and decreased function").
2. Never fabricate. If data is missing, insert [NEED DATA: specific item] inline or prompt for additional context.
3. If you have web access, search for the insurer's medical policy for this drug and condition and cite it.
4. Cite the strongest available evidence supporting this drug for this scenario, in order of preference: (a) insurer's own policy criteria, (b) ACR or relevant society guidelines, (c) published clinical trials or case series, (d) expert consensus. Not all conditions have formal guidelines — use whatever published evidence exists.
5. Include a "Coverage Criteria Mapping" section: list each payer criterion (or guideline/evidence-based criterion if no policy is available), the matching patient evidence, and whether it is met.
6. Include a risk statement: specific clinical harms from treatment delay (joint destruction, steroid toxicity, functional decline, hospitalization risk — use only what applies).
7. Keep the letter to one page. Formal tone, addressed to Medical Director.
